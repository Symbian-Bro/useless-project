Regulates the speed at which the stuff you typed into the keyboard reaches the monitor based on the output from an LDR sensor.
When the ambient light is high, it will slow down the printing speed and when the ambient light is low, does the exact opposite :)

P.S : If you are using Linux, run the program with sudo after stating the path to your virtual environment.
Example - sudo myenv/bin/python3 Useless.py

If you are on Windows, sudo privilege is not required to use the keyboard library :)
