 Discussion with myself
************************

The port checker function and the serial connection establisher function should be placed at 
top of the script. The output of port checker function is used as a parameter to start the 
serial communication. So, port checker should be placed first.

Currently, the threshold is set after a delay of 5 minutes. This was implemented to give users 
enough time to settle down. Now, I've got an idea that it would be better to record the LDR 
for a period of time and then take the average to set the threshold. It sounds better I guess :)
(Lemme go do that then)
